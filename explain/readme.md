# Explain

Explain turns a source file inside-out and generates a beautiful HTML file with
the code and words and presented to be readable. This follows in the tradition
of [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming)
and draws ideas from
[Swift Playgrounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_Playgrounds) and
[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org).
